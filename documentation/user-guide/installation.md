# Installation

The package can be installed with pip.

```bash
pip install bareasgi-graphql-next
```

This is a Python 3.7 and later package with dependencies on:

* bareASGI
* graphql-core-next

There is optional support for graphene:

```bash
pip install bareasgi-graphql-next[graphene]
```

This adds a dependency on a forked version of graphene which supports subscriptions.
